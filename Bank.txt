Create a Java class Bank that simulates basic banking operations. The class should allow users to:

Withdraw money from their account, ensuring they don't withdraw more than their balance or an invalid amount.

Deposit money, with validation for a valid deposit amount.

Change the account holder's name, with proper validation for the new name.

Request a passbook for the account.

Display the current account details, including the account holderâ€™s name, account number, and balance.

Implement a simple menu-driven interface that allows users to interact with these features.

In this Car.class we add OOP's Concept.
